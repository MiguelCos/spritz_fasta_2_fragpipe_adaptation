## Adapt `fasta` files from Spritz for their compatibility with FragPipe/Philosopher  

This script is intended to take the `combined.spritz.snpeff.protein.withdecoys.fasta` from the [Spritz](https://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/Spritz) proteogenomics pipeline, and generate a new `fasta` file with headers compatible with [Philosopher/FragPipe](https://github.com/Nesvilab/FragPipe) [Philosopher documentation](https://github.com/Nesvilab/philosopher/wiki/How-to-Prepare-a-Protein-Database).

It will also generate a tabular file containing annotation information for the variant sequences generated by Spritz.
